Team Name: Epoch parking services (a particular period of time in history or a person's life)

Team Members: David Hansen, Hunter Hatch

  Product goal: Epoch will implement an automated solution between vendors and consumers for parking services during high-profiled
  functions such as concerts, and sporting events. I also believe that this app could serve the purposes of roadtrippers traversing
  unknown territories looking for a spot to camp.
